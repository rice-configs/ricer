__Remember to remove the following information!__

Here some tips for better pull requests:

- Keep pull requests short and simple.
- Keep pull requests focused on one goal/issue rather than multiple.
- Break up large scale changes into multiple pull requests.
- Make sure that your pull requests only last for a couple of days. Avoid long
  standing pull requests.
- Use `git fetch --all -p` to get changes from main and then use
  `get rebase origin/main` to put your changes over the changes on main keeping
  a nice linear history.
- Stash untracked local changes with `git stash -u` and later pop them with
  `git stash pop`.
- Label your pull request if possible.
- For more attention, add a milestone to your pull request if you believe it
  will help advance that milestone you chose.
- Be sure to state status, priority, start data, and deadline to the Rally
  project board to make your progress more visible.
