//! Configuration data management.
//!
//! This module is responsible for providing an interface for managing Ricer's
//! configuration data.
//!
//! Ricer uses `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ricer` to house all of its configuration
//! information. The following represents the overall structure of this
//! directory:
//!
//! ```markdown
//! $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ricer/
//! |-- hooks/
//! |   |-- hook_script1.sh
//! |   |-- hook_script2.sh
//! |   `-- hook_scriptn.sh
//! |-- repos/
//! |   |-- config1.git/
//! |   |-- config2.git/
//! |   `-- confign.git/
//! |-- ignores/
//! |   |-- config1.ignore
//! |   |-- config2.ignore
//! |   `-- confign.ignore
//! `-- config.toml
//! ```
//!
//! The `config.toml` file is the main configuration file for Ricer. The user
//! can directly modify this configuration file through their preferred text
//! editor. However, the user can indirectly modify `config.toml` through
//! Ricer's command set, e.g., init and clone.
//!
//! The `hooks/` directory contains all scripts that the user can use as hooks
//! for Ricer's command set. Ricer _will_ only execute hooks stored in this
//! directory. Thus, the user can refer to hook scripts by name without the need
//! to provide an absolute or relative path, because Ricer will automatically
//! look in the `hooks/` directory for any hook scripts the user wants.
//!
//! > __NOTE:__ The limiting of hook scripts to the `hook/` directory is done
//! > as a very basic security measure. The hope is that the user can easily
//! > identify potentially dangerious hook scripts by centeralizing all scripts
//! > in one easily accessible location.
//!
//! The `repos/` directory contains all the cloned and initialized repositories
//! the user wants Ricer to keep track of. This directory is where Ricer finds
//! and modifies repository information the user passes in through the CLI.
//!
//! Finally, the `ignores/` directory houses exclude/ignore files that ensure
//! that each repository in `repos/` only tracks the portions of the user's
//! home directory that they are responsible for. This ensures that no
//! repository the user is tracking through Ricer attempts to track their
//! entire home directory.
